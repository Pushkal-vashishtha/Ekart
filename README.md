# Project Name

## Overview
This project consists of a frontend and a backend, both of which need to be set up and run separately.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup

### Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
cd project
```

## Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder.
   - Add required environment variables (e.g., database URL, API keys).
4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or specified port in `.env`).

## Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder.
   - Add required variables such as API URLs.
4. Start the frontend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Both Servers Concurrently
If you want to run both frontend and backend together:
```sh
cd backend && npm start & cd ../frontend && npm start
```
(For Windows, use separate terminals or `start cmd /k "npm start"` in each directory.)

## API Documentation
Refer to the API documentation in the `backend/docs` folder or visit `http://localhost:5000/api-docs` (if Swagger is enabled).

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a pull request.
